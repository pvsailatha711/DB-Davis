# DB-Davis
Project Overview:

The Palladium SQL project aims to demonstrate the use of SQL queries for managing and manipulating large datasets effectively. This project focuses on implementing database schemas, complex queries, and data operations on a real-world database. Palladium SQL is ideal for users who want to understand database design, querying, and optimization techniques.

Features:
Database Schema: The project includes a well-structured schema with multiple tables related to products, sales, users, inventory, and more.

Data Operations: Performs essential operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT to manipulate data.

Joins: Implement various SQL join types (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) to combine data across different tables.

Subqueries: Advanced SQL techniques such as subqueries for nested data retrieval.

Aggregation and Grouping: Summarizes data with aggregation functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), GROUP BY, etc.

Indexes: Optimized queries through index creation to speed up data retrieval.

Technologies Used:
Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL (depending on the setup)

SQL: For querying and managing data

Tools: SQL Workbench, pgAdmin/MySQL Workbench

Setup Instructions:
Install PostgreSQL/MySQL on your local machine or use a cloud database provider.

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/pvsailatha711/DB-Davis.

Import the provided SQL script file to create the database schema.

Use the SQL queries from the project folder to manipulate and query data.
